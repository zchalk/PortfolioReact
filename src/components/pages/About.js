      <p>
        I am a full stack MERN developer with an interest in React. My goals when working a project are to capture an aesthetic
        and develop a seamless user experience. I also have a passion for
        developing effective communication with both my team and individuals.
         I am presently located in Fayetteville, NC. I graduated
        UNC Chapel Hill's full stack bootcamp in July 2021.
